# asteroids-scriptable-objects

I aimed to complete this assignment with learning something new. What endeed up happening was not only learning a lot but realising 
the convenience and benefits of a tool. I didn't end up doing as much as I wanted but I did end up with a small working prototype. I used the unity inspector for this.
The next time I work with something like this I want to tackle a editor window.

My small prototype consists of three buttons that changes scriptpleobjects to alter the speed of the ship in the game.

Script name: EngineEditor
